# Services

Angular services are substitutable objects that are wired together using {@link di dependency
injection (DI)}. You can use services to organize and share code across your app.

Angular services are:

* Lazily instantiated – Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends
  on it.
* Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance
  generated by the service factory.

Angular offers several useful services (like {@link ng.$http `$http`}), but for most applications
you'll also want to {@link services#creating-services create your own}.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Like other core Angular identifiers, built-in services always start with `$`
(e.g. `$http`).
</div>
