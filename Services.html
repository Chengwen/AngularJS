Angular services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI). You can use services to organize and share code across your app.

Angular services are:

Lazily instantiated – Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.

- Service components

    $http, $state, $rootScope, $q ...

- Create own services
